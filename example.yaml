# This example provides a basic configuration and description based on the M5STACK components
# For further configuration you should visit the ESPHome docs https://esphome.io
# Every line starting with a # can be removed.

## BASIC CONFIGURATION
esphome:
  name: samsung_ac
  friendly_name: Climate

# Select chipset and board configuration - in this case M5STACK
esp32:
  board: m5stack-atom

# [Optional] - Create web interface where you can control the AC from your web browser (without Home Assistant)
web_server:
  port: 80

# Enable logging
logger:
  level: INFO
  logs:
    component: ERROR # Remove the "Your component takes to long to respond warning"

# Enable native API for communication with Home Assistant, this can be removed if you do not plan to use it with Home Assistant
api:

# Enable OTA firmware update, you will be able to upload the firmware over WiFi without connecting the device by cables
ota:
  platform: esphome

# Setup your WiFi password
wifi:
  ssid: "My WiFi Name" # !!!CHANGE ME!!!
  password: "My WiFi Password" # !!!CHANGE ME!!!

captive_portal:

# Specify pins used by the board to comunicate with RS485 board - in this case M5STACK
uart:
  tx_pin: GPIO19
  rx_pin: GPIO22
  # For older devices it could also be 2400. But you should start with 9600.
  baud_rate: 9600

## SAMSUNG AC CONFIGURATION

# Import custom component from GitHub

  - source: github://brazoayeye/esphome_samsung_ac@main
    components: [samsung_ac]

# Configuration of AC component
samsung_ac:

  #debug_log_messages: true < With this row, all read data from the bus is printed on the terminal
   
  # Capabilities configure the features alle devices of your AC system have (all parts of this section are optional). 
  # All capabilities are off by default, you need to enable only those your devices have.
  # You can override or configure them also on a per devices basis (look below for that).
  #capabilities: 
  #  vertical_swing: true
  #  horizontal_swing: true
    # Presets define special AC modes like Windfree and so on. 
    # The following modes are available: sleep, quiet, fast, longreach, windfree
  #  presets: 
      # short version
  #    quiet: true
      # long version - allows to locilize names
  #    quiet:

  #      enabled: true

  devices:
    # Skip everything below on the first run! Wait a minute, watch your ESPHome logs until you see the "Discovered devices:" section and you see some addresses:
    # For NASA devices it looks like this (with 4 indoor devices): 
    #   Indoor:  20.00.00, 20.00.01, 20.00.02, 20.00.03
    # For NonNASA devices it looks like this (with 2 indoor devices): 
    #   Indoor:  00, 01
    # You need this addresses for the the sections below. If you see only a "-" then you should visit the troubleshooting section in the readme. 

    # Repeat everything below for each indoor device address you see in your logs
    - address: "20.00.00" # Indoor device address 
      # Each property below is optional (climate, room_temperature etc.) - you can delete those which you dont need.
      # For the names we suggest to choose a combination of room name and the thing it controls. 

      # Configures/overrides the capabilites for this devices. 
      # Look above for all options.
